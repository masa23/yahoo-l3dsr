Usage: dsrctl [-d <configdir>] [-f <configfile>] [-ahnvx] <action>
       -a       For status, print status for all discovered loopbacks
                and iptables rules, not just configured DSRs.
       -d dir   Specify DSR config directory.  Defaults to /etc/dsr.d.
       -f file  Read a single DSR config from this file.
                The -d option is ignored if -f is used.
       -h       Print a usage statement and exit.
       -i       Insert rules at the top of the iptables chain instead
                of appending.  The default is to append the rules.
       -k       Keep the xt_DADDR module loaded when stopping DSRs.
                The xt_DADDR module is removed by default when running
                the stop action.
       -n       Don't actually perform the operations.  This option
                is useful with the verbose option.
       -s v:v   Set the sleep values for removing the xt_DADDR module.
                The first value is the number of seconds to wait before
                attempting the first modprobe.  The second value is
                the number of seconds to wait before all subsequent
                attempts to remove the module.  Floating point values
                are allowed.
       -v       Be verbose.  More -v options get more verbose output.
       -x       Don't print the header.
       <action> Run the requested action.  Supported actions are:
                check
                restart
                status
                start
                stop

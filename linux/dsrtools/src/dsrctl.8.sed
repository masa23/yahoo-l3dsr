.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBdsrctl\fP command controls both L3DSR and L2DSR installations based
on configurations found in /etc/dsr.d.
.PP
L3DSR typically involves a load balancer (LB) or VIP that receives packets from the
client.  The LB sets the DSCP field in the TCP packet that corresponds to the
LB and changes the destination IP address in the packet to the real server
(real).  When the real receives the packet, an iptables rule matches the DSCP
and changes the destination IP address back to the LB and then processes the
packet normally.  Any response to the packet is sent to the client directly
without going through the LB.
.PP
L2DSR differs from L3DSR by not utilizing the DSCP field.  No iptables rule is
created to change the destination IP address.  The LB changes the MAC address
in the destination IP packet.  The restriction for L2DSR configurations is
that the reals must all reside in the same local subnet since the MAC address
is being changed.
.PP
The \fBdsrctl\fP command configures L3DSR by initializing loopback aliases
and iptables entries that control how packets are handled on the machine.
The \fBdsrctl\fP \fIstatus\fP command displays the current state
of the L3DSR/L2DSR configurations.
.PP
L3DSR/L2DSR configurations are stored in the \fI/etc/dsr.d\fP directory.  Any
file that ends with \fI.conf\fP is considered a configuration file and is
parsed for configuration information.  DSR configuration files essentially
comprise key=value entries where the key is the LB/VIP IP address and the
value is the DSCP value.  For L2DSR entries, just the VIP is given.  The
configuration file format is defined in \fBdsr.conf\fP(5).
.PP
\fBdsrctl\fP works with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and they can be
intermingled in the same \fI.conf\fP file.  The IPv4 address may be either
a dotted decimal IP address or a fully qualified domain name.  If a fully
qualified domain name is provided, then it defaults to its IPv4 address
even if an IPv6 address exists for the FQDN.  IPv6 addresses may only
be specified as numeric addresses.
.PP
\fBdsrctl\fP properly parses IPv6 VIPs when IPv6 is disabled, but never
attempts to start or stop them.  A \fIstatus\fP request displays IPv6 VIPs
specified in a \fI.conf\fP file as stopped.
.PP
\fBdsrctl\fP operates successfully even if there are other iptables rules or
loopback aliases in use.  \fBdsrctl\fP keeps track of which iptables rules and
loopback aliases are configured on behalf of the DSR configuration and only
modifies those rules and loopbacks.
.PP
It is an error to configure more than one DSR with the same DSCP value unless
the DSCP value is related to one IPv4 address and one IPv6 address.  Two
IPv4 addresses with the same DSCP value or two IPv6 addresses with the same
DSCP value result in an invalid configuration.  If duplicate DSCP values are
detected, then neither the initial nor the duplicate DSRs are started when the
\fIstart\fP action is called. \fBdsrctl\fP does not check whether the IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses refer to the same VIP.
.PP
It is acceptable to configure multiple DSRs with the same IP address as long as
they have different DSCP values.
.PP
L3DSR configurations support using the mangle or raw iptables table for
the requisite iptables rules that implement L3DSR.  The default table is
the raw table, but the mangle table may be selected with the appropriate
iptables configuration.  If the mangle table is desired, create a file in
\fI/etc/modprobe.d\fP (\fIe.g.\fP, \fIxt_DADDR.conf\fP) that contains the following
line.

	options xt_DADDR table=mangle

If \fIxt_DADDR.conf\fP exists, it may already specify a table.  Edit the file
and change the table as needed.  Do not call \fBmodprobe\fP directly with a different
table setting because the change does not survive reboots.  Also, since
kernel modules may be loaded automatically by some commands (\fIe.g.\fP,
\fBiptables\fP/\fBip6tables\fP) and those commands don't pick up any options unless
they are specified in \fI/etc/modprobe.d\fP, the configuration of the iptables table
may not be as expected.  Mindful of these warnings, the following command line
loads the \fBxt_DADDR\fP module with a specific table.

	modprobe xt_DADDR table=mangle

If the installed version of the \fBiptables_daddr\fP package does not support
the raw table (\fIi.e.\fP, versions prior to 0.10.0), then specifying any
table, either in \fI/etc/modprobe.d\fP or on the \fBmodprobe\fP command line,
results in a failure that is evident in the \fBdmesg\fP output.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP

.TP
\fBaction\fP
Run the given action.  Only one action may be specified.  The following
actions are supported.

.RS

.TP
\fBcheck\fP
Provide a one line status about the state of the configured DSRs.

.TP
\fBrestart\fP
The \fBrestart\fP action calls the \fBstop\fP and \fBstart\fP actions.

.TP
\fBstart\fP
Start the DSRs specified by the configuration file(s).  Note that the
\fBiptables\fP command used by \fBdsrctl\fP to start the iptables rules
automatically loads the \fBxt_DADDR\fP module.

.TP
\fBstatus\fP
Display the status of all configured DSRs.  The status contains several columns of information.

.TP
\fBstop\fP
Stop the DSRs specified by the configuration file(s).  If all DSRs are successfully
stopped, then the \fBxt_DADDR\fP module is removed.

.RE

.TP
\fB\-a\fR
Display status not only for the configured DSRs, but for all iptables rules and
loopback aliases that are discovered.
Even with \fB-a\fP, \fBdsrctl\fP does not display iptables rules from iptables
chains that it normally doesn't use.


.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fIdir\fP
use the given \fIdir\fP to search for configuration files instead of the
default (\fI/etc/dsr.d\fP).

.TP
\fBiptbl\fP
The iptbl column indicates for which iptables table the rule is destined.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIfile\fP
Use the given \fIfile\fP as the sole configuration file.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Print the usage statement for \fBdsrctl\fP.

.TP
\fB\-i\fR
Insert rules at the top of the iptables chain instead of appending.  The
default is to append the rules.  The insert-or-append choice applies to all
rules that \fBdsrctl\fP adds to the iptables chain.  This option is ignored
for all actions except \fBstart\fP and \fBrestart\fP.

.TP
\fB\-k\fR
Keep the \fBxt_DADDR\fP module when stopping DSRs.  The \fBxt_DADDR\fP module
is removed by default when running the \fBstop\fP action, but this option
prevents the module from being removed.  This option is ignored for all actions
except \fBstop\fP.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Don't actually perform the operations.  This option is usually paired with
\fB-v\fP in order to see what commands would be run.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIinitval:loopval\fP
Set the sleep values for removing the xt_DADDR module.  The first value
(\fIinitval\fP) is the number of seconds to wait before attempting the first
modprobe.  The second value (\fIloopval\fP) is the number of seconds to wait
before all subsequent attempts to remove the module.  Integer and decimal
fractions are allowed.  Both values must be provided and separated by a colon
with no surrounding spaces.

The default values (\fI0:0.25\fP) are chosen so that the xt_DADDR module is
always removed on all RHEL7 and later releases as long as all iptables rules
related to the xt_DADDR module have been removed.  The maximum default delay
is 2 seconds.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Print more verbose information.  Additional \fB-v\fP options increase the
verbosity.

.TP
\fB\-x\fR
Don't print the header.


.SH "STATUS DISPLAY"

The \fBstatus\fP display provides several fields of information which are
described below.

.TP
\fBtype\fP
The following types are displayed for DSRs, loopbacks, and iptables rules.  A
configured DSR (one found in a .conf file) will always be either \fIl3dsr\fP
or \fIl2dsr\fP. \fBdsrctl\fP only prints configured DSRs unless the \fB-a\fP
option is given.  Configured and discovered DSRs are differentiated via the
\fBsrc\fP column.

.RS

.TP
\fBl3dsr\fP
A DSR has a type of \fBl3dsr\fP when the DSR is a configured or discovered
L3DSR.  Discovered L3DSRs (\fBsrc\fP is disc) are displayed only when the
\fB-a\fP option is requested and \fBdsrctl\fP finds a matched loopback alias
and iptables rule.

.TP
\fBl2dsr\fP
A DSR has a type of \fBl2dsr\fP when the DSR is a configured L2DSR.

.TP
\fBloopb\fP
When the \fB-a\fP option is requested, \fBdsrctl\fP displays a type of
\fBloopb\fP for loopback aliases that are discovered to be active, not matched
with an iptables rule, and not configured from a .conf file.

.TP
\fBiptbl\fP
When the \fB-a\fP option is requested, \fBdsrctl\fP displays a type of
\fBiptbl\fP for iptables rules that are discovered to be active, not matched
with a loopback alias, and not configured from a .conf file.

.RE

.TP
\fBstate\fP
The state is the current state of the DSR, loopback alias, or iptables rule.

.RS

.TP
\fBstopped\fP
The DSR is not running.  For L3DSRs, neither the loopback alias nor the
iptables rule has been activated.  For L2DSRs, the loopback alias has not been
activated.

.TP
\fBstarted\fP
The DSR has been activated.  For L3DSRs, both the loopback alias and the
iptables rule have been activated.  For L2DSRs, the loopback alias has been
activated.

.TP
\fBpartial\fP
This state is only applicable to L3DSRs and is displayed when either the
loopback alias or the iptables rule has been activated, but not both.

.RE

.TP
\fBname\fP
The name displays the name of the DSR.  If the DSR was configured with a FQDN,
then the FQDN is displayed.  If the DSR was configured with a numerical
VIP (IPv4 or IPv6), then the address is displayed.  For discovered DSRs,
loopbacks, and iptables rules, the numerical VIP is always displayed for the
name.

.TP
\fBipaddr\fP
The ipaddr is the numerical VIP address.

.TP
\fBdscp\fP
The dscp value is only applicable for L3DSRs.  For configured L3DSRs, the dscp
value is the value from the .conf file in its original form (decimal, octal,
or hex).  For discovered L3DSRs, the value is taken from the iptables rule.

.TP
\fBloopback\fP
For IPv4 DSRs and discovered loopback aliases, the displayed loopback is in
the form "lo:n" where \fIn\fP signifies the number of the loopback alias.  For
IPv6 DSRs and discovered loopback aliases, the loopback is just displayed as
"lo".  If the loopback alias is not activated, then it is displayed as "--".

.TP
\fBiptables\fP
If the iptables rule is activated, then it is displayed as "up".  Otherwise,
the iptables rule is displayed as "--".

.TP
\fBiptbl\fP
The iptbl column displays which iptables table is being used.  If \fBdsrctl\fP
cannot determine which table is being used, then this field is displayed as
"--".

.TP
\fBsrc\fP
The src column is either \fBconf\fP for configured DSRs or \fBdisc\fP for
discovered DSRs, loopback aliases and iptables rules.  This column is only
displayed when the \fB-a\fP option is requested.


.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
Exit status is 0 if OK, 1 if there are errors (\fIe.g.\fP, failure to start the DSR
configuration, syntax errors, failure to
find the configuration file, configuration errors in the \fI.conf\fP files,
not executing as root, running on unsupported RHEL releases, etc.).

.SH FILES
.TP
/etc/dsr.d
This directory is the location where DSR configuration files are stored.  Only
files that end with \fI.conf\fP are considered configuration files and all
others are ignored.

.TP
/etc/rc.d/init.d/dsr (for distros using SySV init)
The \fBdsr\fP rcfile runs during every boot to start all of the configured DSRs.

.TP
/usr/lib/systemd/system/dsr.service (for distros using systemd)
The \fBdsr\fP service runs during every boot to start all of the configured DSRs.

.TP
/sys/module/xt_DADDR/parameters/table (0.10.0 or later)
Once the \fBxt_DADDR\fP module is loaded, \fBdsrctl\fP reads this file to determine
which iptables table is being used.
